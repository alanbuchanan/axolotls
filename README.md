#### Tools
- **Front end**: I used the [angular-fullstack Yeoman generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack), alongside Angular Material, and a tiny bit of Bootstrap. Masonry came in extremely useful for the grid.
- **Back end**: Node.js & Express with MongoDB for storing users and pins.
